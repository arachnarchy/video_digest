 this whole 2-week effort has been a calculated and orchestrated political hit  fueled with a parent pent-up anger about President Trump in the 2016 election  fear that has been unfairly stoked about my judicial record revenge on behalf of the clintons  and millions of dollars in money from outside left-wing opposition groups  this is a circus  I will not be intimidated into withdrawing from this process you've tried hard  you giving it your all no one can question your effort  but your coordinated and well-funded effort to destroy my good name and destroy my family will not drive me out  the bio threats of violence against my family will not drive me out  you may defeat me in the final vote  but you'll never get me to quit never  I'm not questioning the doctor Ford may have been sexually assaulted by some person in some place at some time  but I've never done this to her or to anyone  that's not who I am it is not who I was I am innocent of this charge  I intend no ill-will to dr. Ford in her family the other night Ashley in my daughter Liza said their prayers and Little Liza all 10 years old  said to Ashley we should pray for the woman  a lot of wisdom from a 10 year old  we mean we mean no LOL
