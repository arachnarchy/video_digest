 1 x 4  is the limits of creativity  and makes me ordinary  extraordinary  every day we're trying to build more and more complex things complex buildings and cars and clothing and that's harder and harder to build as time goes on  Skylar Tibbits invents new ways to build things  forget the factory it's time for the future we recently developed a new printing process  typically 3D printers are fairly slow you know you print objects about this size so we came up with a new process where we actually print into a tank of gel  by printing in that we eliminate gravity we can just draw in 3D space  with our rapid liquid printing process we can print 50 times faster than typical 3D printing  they can print a beach bag in 45 minutes or we can print a lamp in tens of minutes  a whole range of different materials from flexible materials to Ridge and materials even the concrete  Skylar can even create ingredients that do the work on their own  this pieces of lamination it's created with two rolls of material that been are combined into one single material when we shine light on it the material then transform  she'll see that the elements open and close just by Shining Light on to this textile  this could be used to make smarter buildings  imagine a wall knowing to open itself and let in Morning Light materials sense their environment  essentially making everyday materials into robot  that includes the stuff we where you can think about all the different types of clothing that we have rain jackets or down jackets to pick us warmer when it's cold outside or imagining like one Garmin or one piece of apparel that can transform  our vision is to make every material smart material  you want to make textiles wood metal who won all of these traditional materials that we work with to have this programmable capability for trying to rethink the way we design a really simple elegant way without lots of robots and Electro mechanical systems just simple materials that are smarter and smarter
