 Alex silky troop 4 months have passed  William. Wooden sides and his challenge now is to keep up with the truth  but his judgment isn't always perfect  his dexterity has improved ideas on how to tackle the Abundant Forest fruits  and he's not afraid to take on the older juveniles  he's only 8 months old and it's a bit risky to be wrestling with a twenty-month-old about twice his size sometimes infant to do fall to the ground when they're in these rather aggressive lengthy play wrestling bouts certainly the 20 month old was not wrestling as intensely as he usually does it seem like a two-year-old was kind of Tony it down a little bit it's okay so far away is is remarkable and complex and detailed we could bring a wrestling coach out here and they could actually score headlocks pins flips tosses across the shoulder and there be some new moves that silkies could do it that they wouldn't know how to score you know like that hang upside down by 1 foot grabbing the tale of another one and put it in your mouth and fighting them that would be a silky only yeah  Windham may not win every round yet but he's well on the way to holding his own
