 language app is saying but one you can have the FBI the CIA in the Foreign Legion and they're not going to tell you anymore than you know now that's my view but we'll see what happens and he's got a week is enough for him or maybe less so we're not playing this game I've opening us up and it goes on forever what he said was that I would feel better if they had a week to look at what's in front of us no more some Democrats that said okay with that and I'd like them to come for Diamond go talk to Mission Jeff and eventually engage for the White House but you know again I don't think we need this I am long since ready to vote I think he's been very poorly treated Judge Kevin up a little bit judge cabinet combination absolutely not I think I think Jeff feels good about Judge Kevin I just want to make sure the process is fair but you need to ask him I've never felt better about him being on the bench than I do right now  this morning saying he was going to vote yet so what chain democracy talk to his colleagues and are going Jeff please please just give us a few more days just a really good guy I wouldn't have done it. But please let's be fair and Jeff is trying to be fair I just don't see if we're going to benefit from anything and turnips I've been doing this most of my adult life is 35 years ago you know what you know and you've heard what you're going to hear but having said that this is called democracy something people in the country feel better about this person on the Supreme Court if a week from now the FBI comes back and says we're good I think the people in the country or going to feel differently awake for now you can probably put in a phone-booth however if Jeff feels better about it I feel better  Sears on his way to vote this morning this is Jeff Lake I mean this is why I actually like about the guy Susan at all these people take it really seriously Jeff is not a lawyer this is hard again I've been in the legal system you have a lot of emotional decisions to make but the fact pattern here leaves itself do you know I'm sorry there's just not enough we got to move on but having said that this is Jeff late being very sincere and what he's trying to do I respect the hell out of this trying to get some Democrats to buy in will a week matter and some of them said it would someone want to just go on and on and on but can't get a few of them to say a week longer would make it a better progress process then he's probably done that, because you agreed to a one-week senator
