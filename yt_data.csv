Insects are everywhere! They're found on every continent including Antarctica, and nearly a million species of insects have been discovered! Since new insects are being discovered all the time, scientists suspect that millions more are just waiting for us to find them. You've probably seen plenty of insects in your life - bees, ants, butterflies, beetles, and mosquitoes - and you may even know that all insects have six legs.

20,wB6sHhQ3EcY,UCh-sQC1L3J7xicFO1Bo5DeQ,Giant Stick Insect Amazing Beautiful Nature,stick insect giant stick insect big stick insect Phasmatodea walking stick stick bugs insect critter amazing nature long stick insect ghost insect camouflage the stick insect walking stick insect stick insect pet insect pet creepy insect weird insect twig insect,"Imagine if your life was trying to imitate a stick, well here is a garden critter who was caught out and needed re-location to where he's far less obvious. These are the longest insect in the world and are expert at moving and looking like sticks. 

The Phasmatodea (sometimes called Phasmida or Phasmatoptera) are an order of insects, whose members are variously known as stick insects (in Europe and Australasia), walking sticks or stick-bugs (in the United States and Canada), phasmids, ghost insects and leaf insects (generally the family Phylliidae). The ordinal name is derived from the Ancient Greek φάσμα phasma, meaning an apparition or phantom, and refers to the resemblance of many species to sticks or leaves. Their natural camouflage can make them extremely difficult to spot. Phasmatodea can be found all over the world in warmer zones, especially the tropics and subtropics. The greatest diversity is found in Southeast Asia and South America, followed by Australia. Phasmids also have a considerable presence in the continental United States, mainly in the Southeast.

Phasmatodea species exhibit mechanisms for defense from predators that both prevent an attack from happening in the first place (primary defense) and are deployed after an attack has been initiated (secondary defense). The defense mechanism most readily identifiable with Phasmatodea is camouflage, in the form of plant mimicry. Most phasmids are known for effectively replicating the forms of sticks and leaves, and the bodies of some species (such as Orxines macklotti and Palophus centaurus) are covered in mossy or lichenous outgrowths that supplement their disguise. Some species have the ability to change color as their surroundings shift (Bostra scabrinota, Timema californica). In a further behavioral adaptation to supplement crypsis, a number of species perform a rocking motion where the body is swayed from side to side; this is thought to mimic the movement of leaves or twigs swaying in the breeze. Another method by which stick insects avoid predation and resemble twigs is by feigning death (thanatosis), where the insect enters a motionless state that can be maintained for a long period. The nocturnal feeding habits of adults also help Phasmatodea to remain concealed from predators.

Although there are hundreds of objects in the solar system that could potentially be classified as dwarf planets, as of 2017 there are only five officially recognized ones: Ceres, Pluto, Eris, Haumea, and Makemake. Unlike planets, dwarf planets have not cleared their orbits of objects and debris.

Unfortunately, an ecosystem can become unbalanced through natural or manmade disturbances. The good news? Ecosystems can recover if we just help them out a little!

[Stay tuned for another 60 sec. specimen story TOMORROW!]

Before he was charged and convicted with the murder of 14-year-old Bobby Franks, Nathan Leopold was an active birder in the Chicago community. After his conviction and sentencing he donated his collection of birds and published checklists to the Field Museum, where they remain today. 

Kirtland's Warblers (Setophaga kirtlandii) are relatively rare birds, and back in the 1920's little was known about their migration behavior or life histories. This specimen remains important today -- not just for its historical significance in connection with a convicted murderer -- but for the scientific value it provides as a voucher specimen for research.

Field Museum scientists and their collaborators came across this 1984 Ford Bronco parked on the side of the road in Puerto Rico during a research expedition. They were looking for lichens: plant-like organisms that are comprised of a symbiotic relationship between an algae, and a fungus. After trying to figure out how to get the entire vehicle back to the Field in Chicago, they settled on taking the door. Today, we're still learning new things about the lichens that call this rusty door home.

Why is it so difficult to cure cancer? Kyuson Yun explains the challenges.

As far as we know, there’s only one thing in our solar system sophisticated enough to study itself: the human brain. But this self-investigation is challenging because a living brain is shielded by skull, swaddled in tissue, and made up of billions of tiny cells. How do we study living brains without harming their owners? Elizabeth Waters and John Brorghi explain how EEGs, fMRIs, and PETs work.

It feels good to give back but then again…$50 is $50.

Twenty dollars is a lot of money...well, maybe not that much. But how much of that money would you be willing to share with another person?

We gathered strangers, couples, friends, and family alike for our premiere experiment in the Science of Empathy. What cut of the twenty dollars would you give away, when you consider someone else’s feelings?

Research has shown that cutting boards, dish towels and sponges have FAR more fecal bacteria on them than your toilet seat, highlighting the very sophisticated scientific ways we have of detecting bacteria as well as the sophisticated natural ways our bodies have of taking care of low levels of that harmful bacteria.  So that's good news...

Why is Earth is a blue planet? Because it’s covered in water! Where did Earth’s water come from? Of course, water isn’t unique to our planet. The origin of water traces beyond the solar system to the earliest days of the universe. Here’s the story of the galaxy’s H2O.

Where do glaciers and icebergs get their beautiful blue color? This unique blue might be nature’s most brilliant, and the color arises in a very special way thanks to some surprising interactions between light and water molecules. Who knew physics could be so breathtaking?

Waste not, want not… right? Poop, in all of its various forms throughout nature, shapes the world in ways you might not imagine. One creature’s waste is another’s fuel, and all over nature these leftovers help new life spring up. Here’s how whales, birds, worms, bats, and more help the world breathe clean, thanks to their poop.

Glacier ice is weird. It’s solid. Solid things aren’t supposed to flow. But glacier ice flows like a liquid, and it does that without melting! How is this possible? I traveled to Mendenhall Glacier in Juneau, Alaska to find out.

Why do Africa and South America fit together? Anyone who’s ever looked at a map can see that Earth’s continents are kind of like a jigsaw puzzle. The idea that continents are constantly moving and weren’t always in their current spots is a pretty obvious idea, right? You might be surprised to learn that geologists only accepted that idea recently in the past few decades, and it figuring out how plate tectonics and continental drift work required some pretty strange evidence.

Among living things, the color blue is oddly rare. Blue rocks, blue sky, blue water, sure. But blue animals? They are few and far between. And the ones that do make blue? They make it in some very strange and special ways compared to other colors. In this video, we'll look at some very cool butterflies to help us learn how living things make blue, and why this beautiful hue is so rare in nature.

It’s been estimated that 1 in 10 works of fine art are forged or misattributed. The truth is, no one really knows how much fake art is out there, because many art counterfeiters are so skilled that their paintings are almost indistinguishable from the real works. But even counterfeiters can’t beat physics! From atomic bomb remnants to ancient atoms, here’s some of the amazing ways that science can detect fake art.

Ever notice how cereal clumps up in your bowl, or how cereal sticks to the edges of the bowl? Bubbles in beverages do the same thing.You've probably seen this surface tension and buoyancy at work, but did you know there's some mind-blowing science behind it? What we learn in our cereal bowl even connects to the lives of tiny insects that walk on water.

From spirals to spots to fractals, nature is full of interesting patterns. Many of these patterns even resemble geometric shapes. One of the most common? Hexagons. Why do we see this six-sided shape occur so many times in nature? This week we explore why hexagons are so common in the natural world, from honeycomb to bubbles to rocks, and what their mathematics, physics, and biology may have in common.

Since the days of Ancient Greece, philosophers and scientists have been wondering: What is space? Is the absence of things… a thing? These questions continued to fascinate physicists in the modern era, leading Isaac Newton, Ernst Mach, and Albert Einstein to wonder about the true nature of the fabric of the cosmos. The search for an answer led them to some of the greatest theories in physics. This week, we ask if space and time are really real, and how they come together to make “spacetime”!

Living things have engineered some pretty awesome materials, but I'm not sure anything measures up to spider silk. It's as strong, as stretchy, and as resilient than even humans' most advanced creations like Kevlar and steel. So how do these awesome arachnids weave such an incredible substance using nothing but their rear ends? And… what IS this stuff? I went to meet Dr. Cheryl Hayashi, one of the world's experts in spider silk, to find out.

Do you ever talk to your dog? Do they ever talk back? Humans and dogs have a truly amazing relationship, developed along an evolutionary journey that goes back nearly 10,000 years. Do they really understand what we say, think, and feel? Recent research suggests dogs know more about our language and emotions than you might think

Most people are taught that dinosaurs went extinct 66 million years ago when a giant meteor crashed into the Yucatan peninsula. I'm here to tell you that's wrong. Dinosaurs are alive and well today, and you don't have to go to Jurassic World to see them (although hanging out with Chris Pratt would be cool)

Of all the species that humans have domesticated, dogs are our oldest animal friends. But how did a group of wolves become the furry pup at the end of the bed? New research is finally unlocking the paw-in-hand evolution of dogs and humans. In this episode we’re answering one big question: Did we domesticate dogs, or did dogs domesticate us? 

Special thanks to our friends from MinuteEarth!

Scientists overwhelmingly agree that our climate is changing, Earth is getting warmer, sea levels are rising, and it's primarily because of humans putting lots of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Yet 4 in 10 Americans aren't convinced
Here's what psychologists and sociologists have to say about why some people don't believe in climate science.

We've heard news of ""peak oil"" and ""the end of the oil age"" for years now, but we keep coming up with ways to find and pump more of it to the surface. Rising CO2 levels and the changing climate that results from burning fossil fuels mean that we should probably stop using oil sooner rather than later, though
Let's take a look at history and see how we've used different fuels, so that we might figure out when and how to make oil a thing of the past

An intermittent fasting diet is one of the hippest new nutrition and fitness philosophies, based around the idea that going hungry can be good for your health. Some think it’s a weight loss secret that calls upon our ancient evolutionary programming. We look at the science behind intermittent fasting.

I’m tall. Most of the people in my family are tall. Does that mean my son will be tall? Turns out the inheritance of height is a lot more complicated than we thought. Scientists know that nature (genes) and nurture (environment) both play a role, but after more than a century of questions, we’re only just now starting to get some answers

Have you ever noticed that warning about raw or undercooked seafood at the bottom of restaurant menus? Ever wondered why it’s there? Because fish carry a ton of parasites, and if they aren’t prepared correctly then those parasites can make it into your body. But it turns out, this fishy intersection with the wild world of parasites can teach us a lot about how these moochers help keep ecosystems healthy, and why we should protect them.

I noticed something weird about Disney Princesses lately. Naturally, I had to examine it through the lens of science. The answer led me to new knowledge about human development, the domestication and taming of animals, and why we find things cute in the first place. You’ll never look at cartoons the same way again

Farting is hilarious and gross and everyone is doing it so why can’t we talk about the science of it?! Flatulence, passing gas, cutting the cheese, toots… whatever you call it, it's natural and here's how it works.

Asteroid mining sounds like something out of a bad space movie, but harvesting materials from space rocks might be our ticket to building space colonies or living on Mars. Most of Earth’s precious and rare metals are locked too far in the crust for us to get at them, and launching them to space is too expensive for us to supply large colonies off Earth or explore far off worlds. How do we get our hands on the planetary resources inside asteroids? Let’s find out!

Why is the universe organized the way it is? And why is it so empty? From planets and stars to superclusters and galactic filaments, the universe’s largest structures formed because of its smallest. In this special collaboration with PHD Comics, we’ll learn how the earliest, quantumest blips seeded the structure of everything everywhere.

Kamau Bell in an extended episode.

Dive into Bourdain's world: https://explorepartsunknown.com/

Following are the locations and episode descriptions for the new season:

Kenya (season 12 premiere: September 23 – special extended episode 9pm-10:15pm ET)   Bourdain introduces his fellow CNN Original Series host W. Kamau Bell (United Shades of America) to the distinctive sights, tastes, and sounds of Kenya.  It is Bell’s first trip to the African continent, and to a country that holds a personal connection for him. In Nairobi, they talk to locals about the country’s growth and economic challenges, as well as the continual fight for identity and self-definition of Kenyans.  Bourdain and Bell also take a Matatu party bus ride, share a meal of goat’s head soup and visit a boxing academy devoted to teaching young women, and promoting female empowerment. Leaving Nairobi the pair travel to Lewa Wildlife Conservancy and visit with a Maasai community actively engaged in conservation.  Through the eyes of Bourdain and Bell, and their first experiences with this highly dynamic deeply, soulful and beautiful country we ask, what will a future Kenya… for Kenyans…. by Kenyans…look like?

Asturias, Spain (September 30) Bourdain travels to the enchanted region of Asturias, Spain with chef and humanitarian Jose Andres, as he makes a return to his homeland.  The people of Asturias embody the rugged environment of the region with a hard working ‘do it yourself’ spirit. Bourdain and Andres hike to a remote village in the mountains for traditional fabada, ocean cliffs for gooseneck barnacles, and secret cheese caves in undisclosed locations.  Bourdain also enjoys pitu de caleya with local musician Pablo Und Destruktion while he’s served on the last worker’s class movement. And in true Jose Andres form, he saves a special surprise for the end.

Indonesia (October 7 ) A shadow puppet performance provides an entry into understanding Indonesia, a country comprised of thousands of islands whose people endured political turmoil, and one in which, Bourdain discovers, food is the great unifier. In this fourth largest country in the world, every area has it’s own unique traditions. In Jakarta, Bourdain eats at a Padang Restaurant where nearly every menu item comes to the table; while in Bali he visits the beach, commenting on yoga before joining in a traditional Balinese Funeral ceremony.

Bourdain’s Impact (October 14) This episode explores how Anthony Bourdain’s unique perspective and voice altered the world of food, travel and culture and in the process reinvented how audiences watched television and engaged intimately and actively with the world around them.

Far West Texas (October 21) Bourdain travels to the untamed land of Big Bend, Texas near the Mexican border; an area that pits man against nature and in which the land usually wins. Bourdain shares meals with working cowboys who have made peace with the rough terrain, and meets with an anthropologist who decoded prehistoric landmark, the White Shaman wall painting.

Behind the Scenes (October 28) Bourdain’s relationship with his crew, the team that traveled with him and slogged through the trenches, was like no other in his life. In this episode the people who made Parts Unknown select moments from their episodes and pull back the curtain, to talk about collaboration, creative freedom, moments when Bourdain had their back or called them out, the times when he was caught off guard or forgot the cameras were even there.   

Lower East Side (November 11 special extended episode 9pm-10:15pm ET) Bourdain takes a personal journey through this formerly bohemian New York City neighborhood, as he meets, shares meals and reflects with music, film and art trailblazers including Richard Hell, Deborah Harry and Chris Stein, Lydia Lunch, Fab 5 Freddy, Danny Fields, Amos Poe, Jim Jarmusch, Kembra Pfahler, John Lurie, Clayton Patterson and Harley Flanagan, whose collective cultural  impact in the 1970’s and ’80’s has sustained through the decades.",292.0,edu

Sexual harassment is teasing or touching in any way that makes a person feel uncomfortable. The AAUW, the American Association of University Women, found that in one school year about half of all the students had encountered some form of harassment. Sexual harassment can happen to anyone, anywhere. In fact, one in three students reports that they have been harassed through a text, email or Facebook. Unfortunately, it was found that only half the students who were victimized reported it. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court has ruled that schools must take steps to stop harassment. Schools are required to set up policies to make clear that harassment will not be tolerated. Teens are urged to talk to somebody if they are being harassed.

In addition to academic stress, there's a LOT of social pressure. Girls tend to have more drama and hold on to things for much longer than boys. There’s also a lot of pressure to look perfect, to wear the right clothes and hang with the right clique. Also, we report on ways to avoid being a victim. In middle school, kids develop new ways to hurt each other and, unfortunately, much of that has to do with exclusion and not allowing people to be in your group. “Girl Talk” is an organization that aims to help. It is a student to student mentoring program where high school girls mentor middle school girls. The founder of “Girl Talk” offers some good advice for girls in middle school.

We hear from a group of boys as they express what makes middle school difficult for them. Their answers varied from academic challenges to social issues. Many boys feel under pressure to be fast, strong and athletic. Middle school boys must also deal with their peers’ sometimes insulting and making fun of them. Plus Scott gives us some ways boys can deal with the challenges of middle school.  Things that can help are:   take advantage of the different activities and clubs offered in middle school; or even consider starting your own club. Scott also explores the difficulty boys have dealing with girls in middle school.

The Onin War tore Japan apart, but also kicked off the Sengoku Jidai or Warring States Period that's a seminal part of Japanese history. The power of the shogun dissolved and regional clan leaders or daimyo fought for control of the country. In the mid 16th century, near Kyoto, a clan called the Matsudaira found itself pinched between two great rivals: the Oda and the Imagawa. Abducted as a hostage by the Oda, the scion of the Matsudaira clan (the young Tokugawa Ieyasu) grew up to fight alongside of the Imagawa when he was released. Their combined forces threatened to destroy the entire Oda clan, but Oda Nobunaga had a different idea. They clashed at the Battle of Okehazama.

The Insider - ""A Difficult Subject""

Transcript:

You’ve probably heard a lot about gluten in the news. It’s the stuff that makes bread chewy, a protein formed by two chemicals, glutenin and gliadin. Humans have been eating it for at least 10,000 years, and it’s one of the most heavily consumed proteins on Earth. Recently gluten has become the latest nutritional boogeyman. Anti-gluten evangelists claim it causes everything from obesity to cancer. Medical and nutritional experts take a dim view of many of those claims. Here are 3 of the biggest gluten myths they’re trying to debunk.

1. Lots of People Are Gluten-intolerant 

Actually, it's only a small number. About 1% of the U.S. population has celiac disease, an autoimmune disorder that injures the small intestine and prevents patients from absorbing other nutrients from food when they ingest gluten. It can cause awful side effects, from gastrointestinal distress and chronic fatigue to anemia. Additionally, another 6% of the American public may have a controversial condition called non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS). Even for some people with NCGS, gluten may not be the real problem. In a 2013 study, researchers found that when excluding a broad class of nutrients called FODMAPS − which includes everything from fructose to bananas and asparagus – from NCGS patients’ diets, they stopped having gastrointestinal distress, even when they ate gluten.

2. To Avoid Gluten, You Need to Buy Special Food 

OK, so maybe you need to stay away from gluten because of celiac disease or NCGS. Or maybe you're just convinced that gluten is bad for you. Companies that manufacture gluten-free foods can’t wait to meet – and overcharge - you. A bag of gluten-free chocolate chip cookies, for example, may cost close to five times as much as the regular kind. But you don't need to buy a $13 bag of cookies or a $6 loaf of bread to avoid gluten. A lot of foods naturally don't have any gluten in them, including fruits, vegetables, meats, poultry, fish, nuts, milk, most cheeses and yogurt, herbs, spices, and oils, butter, margarines, rice, certain cereals, and corn tortillas.

3. It's Possible to Live Completely Gluten-free 

Eating a 100% gluten-free diet may be theoretically possible, but according to National Foundation for Celiac Awareness president Alice Bast ""in reality, it's nearly an impossible feat.” The FDA actually allows products to be labeled gluten-free, even if they contain up to 20 parts per million. Further, the FDA doesn't actually require food manufacturers to test their finished products for gluten content. The FDA reassures people with celiac disease that all this probably doesn't put them at too much risk, since research shows that most of them can tolerate extremely small amounts of gluten. But for those who believe that gluten is an intolerable poison that must be avoided in any amount, the reality is going to be difficult to swallow.

What do you think? Are people exaggerating the dangers of gluten, or ignoring a very real danger? Let me know in the comments below, and for more info, check out our article 10 Myths About Gluten at HowStuffWorks.com.",266.0,edu

* Lon Chaney Senior is known as one of the greatest actors of the silent era of film. But did you know that he also did all his own elaborate makeup when he played grotesque villains who were scarred, mutilated or paralyzed? See, Chaney was raised by parents who were both deaf and mute, so he was already skilled in the art of pantomime when he got to Hollywood. He enhanced this by altering his flesh with cotton, wires and even fish skin. The best tool in Chaney’s arsenal was a viscous liquid called collodion that appeared like scarred skin. He employed all of these tricks in his masterful performance as the Phantom of the Opera, going so far as to give himself nosebleeds from a wire that made turned up his nose. Chaney was such a master of makeup that he was asked to write the entry on it for the 14th edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica. 
* Remember in “The Exorcist” when young Linda Blair transforms into a vomiting demon whose head spins around 360 degrees? We can thank Dick Smith for that monstrosity. He built a fiberglass version of Blair’s head for the scene. What’s even more impressive is that Smith also made then 44-year old Max von Sydow appear to be 74 years old in the same film! Over 40 years later, von Sydow’s finally starting to catch up to Smith’s aging effects. Smith also aged Dustin Hoffman 100 years in “Little Big Man” and gave Marlon Brando his infamous jowls in “The Godfather.” He won an Academy Award in 1984 for “Amadeus” and received a lifetime honorary award in 2011. Thanks to Smith’s developments, the industry now uses a more realistic technique of layering facial molds as separate prosthetics, instead of just having an actor wear a mask.
* One of Smith’s assistants on “The Exorcist” was Rick Baker, who went on to create the horrifying transformation scene in “An American Werewolf in London.” No CGI was used to pull this off. It was all makeup and animatronics. Baker won an Oscar for his work, the first “achievement in makeup and hairstyling.”  He also helped populate the cantina in “Star Wars,” designed the 1976 King Kong and raised the dead for Michael Jackson’s “Thriller” video.
* Another protege of Smith’s is Stan Winston, who has won multiple Oscars and designed makeup effects for “Aliens,” “Terminator,” “Predator” and “Edward Scissorhands.” In “Terminator 2,” Winston designed a fiberglass replica of Robert Patrick’s head that would spring open. This was used in the scene where the T-1000 reforms after being blown apart by a shotgun. Winston’s so dedicated he even built full-scale animatronic dinosaurs for the original “Jurassic Park.”
* As Baker was a student of Smith, he in turn passed his knowledge down to artist Rob Bottin. Hired at age 14, Bottin learned on the set of “Star Wars” before going on to create effects for “Robocop,” “Total Recall,” “The Thing” and “The Howling.” In that last picture, Bottin glued inflatable sacs to the actors faces to show them transforming into werewolves. And in “Total Recall,” he made a malformed puppet of actress Rachel Ticotin to simulate her head decompressing on the surface of Mars. During work on John Carpenter’s horror classic “The Thing,” Bottin worked so hard that he was hospitalized with exhaustion, double pneumonia and a bleeding ulcer. Oh… and he was only 21 at the time!",337.0,edu

Unsere Körper benutzen ein Mercedes-Benz TV: MAGIC BODY CONTROL TV commercial Mercedes-Benz TV Magic Body Control,"Post to your facebook -- http://on.fb.me/CHICKNMAN

Pennywhistle Productions/Smarter Every Day

Chickens have a great ability to keep their heads stable.  Our bodies use a gyro-like mechanism in our ears which has 3 mutually orthogonal inertial measurement devices.  Modern motion processors use something called an Inertial Measurment Unit (IMU).  These devices provide movement data which can be used to compensate for the movement.  Chickens apparently have the same type mechanism only with a higher update rate.

*Update* The chickens were eaten by the family dog.  WHOOPS!  :(

*Update #2* Sis and I are shot a music video. If you're interested search for ""Briley brand new key""

*Update #3*
Currently under non-exclusive license to be played on Fuji-TV in Japan.  Ha Ha.  Who would have thought?

*Update #4* July 10th, 2009   1 MILLION HITS Woo Hoo!

* Update #5 Sep 25th 2013  This idea was used in a commercial by Mercedes: ""Mercedes-Benz TV: MAGIC BODY CONTROL TV commercial ""

~~~~~~~~ German / Deutsch  courtesy of Bursaap ~~~~~
Hühner haben eine bermerkenswertige Fähigkeit ihre Köpfe stabil zu halten. Unsere Körper benutzen ein gyroskopisches Mechanismus das drei gegenseitige senkrechte biomechanische Inertialsensore. Moderne bewegungs Prozessoren benutzen einen sogennanten Inertial Measurement Unit, eine art Inertialsensor. Diese Geräte geben Daten an so dass es möglich ist die Bewegnung auszugleichen. Hühner haben anscheinend das selbe Biomechanismus aber mit höhreren aktualisierungs Häufigkeit.
*Update* Die Hühner wurden bei dem Familienhund gefressen! OOOPS 

*Update #2* Meine Schwester und Ich haben ein Musikvideo aufgenommen. Wenn es Sie interresiert suchen Sie ""Briley brand new key""

*Update #3*
Dieses Video wird in Japan auf Fuji-TV Spielen. Ha Ha. Wer hätte es gedacht?

*Update #4* July 10th, 2009 Eine Million hits! Geil!

Instead of saving for my kids' college, I make videos using the money I would have saved.
The thought is it will help educate the world as a whole, and one day generate enough revenue to pay for their education.  Until then if you appreciate what you've learned in this video and the effort that went in to it, please share the video.

King Shark is monstrous, terrifying, and a formidable foe for many characters in the DC universe. His origin is as interesting as the character himself, as it's hard to pin down exactly what King Shark really is. On this edition of Supervillain Origins, we'll try to get to the bottom of this character, and take a look at the many times he's stood in the way of the pantheon of DC heroes.

Venom is a lot of things: deadly, dastardly, mysterious... did we mention deadly? Though the Venom Symbiote has had many hosts, and a long backstory that is as confusing as it is fascinating, he has nonetheless become one of Spider-Man's best-known villains and one of Marvels' premier characters.  

As with most comic book characters, there are often re-imaginings and different versions to a character’s past. We have chosen primarily to follow the storyline which unfolded in 1984’s Amazing Spider-Man #258 and 1985’s Web of Spider-Man #1 and which was expanded upon in 1988’s Amazing Spider-Man #300, 1995’s Venom Super-Special #1, 2009’s Venom: Dark Origin #1, and 2016’s Venom Space Knight #8 and 12.

The Joker is an iconic Batman villain and has been for years, though the origins and true identity of The Clown Prince of Crime are unclear. The Dark Knight has had his hands full with The Joker in a number of incarnations, from his beginnings in Detective Comics, to the film The Dark Knight, with Heath Ledger as The Joker, and Batman: The Animated Series, where Mark Hamill’s voice talent breathed life into the character. The Red Hood, the vat of chemicals, the tough childhood, and the difficult family life: all of these have been used in different ways to tell the story of how the Joker came to be.

LYRICS

Once upon a time, there was a little fella named Cuphead.
He and his brother had a bit of a gambling problem, and things got kind of out of hand.
The sleazy townsfolk met together that night to discuss the problem,
knowing that Cuphead would soon be coming for them…

You’ve all probably heard the rumors-
-about this plucky little fella named Cuphead-
-He’s coming to collect on our deals with The Devil-
-and we need to stop him!

Hey! He’s comin’ this way, so beware!
Say, let’s shoot him right out of the air!
I could put him on icing myself!
And we three veggies won’t be so good for his health!

Let’s just smash him!
Or whack him with a trout!
We could thrash him-
And then pour his insides out!

We’re gonna kill off Cuphead!
We’re gonna make him die!
We’re gonna kill off Cuphead
with a big goodbye!

We’re gonna kill off Cuphead!
We’re gonna make him pay!
His debt to the Devil
is coming due today!

Ooo, just wait’ll I get my wings on that Cuphead!
I’d like to chip his china…

I’ll see that his life is cut short!
While I call in the cops to come bee support!
Why not give him the ride of his life!
Then shank that shnook with a briar sharp as a knife!

Let’s use science!
And arm ourselves for war!
Sky-high violence-
-is what Cuphead has in store!

We’re gonna kill off Cuphead!
We’re gonna make him die!
We’re gonna make him fish food!
And zen ve’ll make him fry!

We’re gonna kill off Cuphead!
We’re gonna make him pay!
His debt to the Devil
is coming due today!

One shift of the stars,
and the tide is sure to turn!
Too bad
Cuphead’s about to lose big!
Three heads will hunt him
till Cuphead feels the burn
For the rest of his
headlining gig!

They call me King Dice, cause that’s who I am!
A royal pain whose diabolical plan
to close some contracts needs a sucker or two.
So come on, Cuphead! Kid, I’m talking to you!
Come shake my hand!
We got a deal?
Good, cause now it gets real…

You agreed to my game and you lost! 
You accepted the odds, now you’ll cough up the cost!
Don’t screw with me kid, or I swear
I’ll take my tea from your skull like cheap chinaware!

Scare him!

Scorch him!
Let’s liquify his brains!
Taze him!
Torch him!
And then bury his remains!

We’re gonna kill off Cuphead!
We’re gonna make him die!
It’s his final curtain!
And the end is nigh!

We’re gonna kill off Cuphead!
We’re gonna make him pay!
His debt to the Devil
Is coming due today! (x5)

And they all live happily ever after! Wait, no they didn’t.
I’m pretty sure those people killed him.
Oh well. Circle of Life.",266.0,rec

Lyrics

Ninja Brian, I invited a large number of girls over here for an orgy, but the responses thus far haven’t been what I’d hoped for

Stacy had a headache
Jenny was in jail    
Brenda had to work late
Kate was getting Jenny’s bail

Angela got scurvy
Ashley caught a cold
Sally’s dad exploded
That’s what I was told

Michelle had to play checkers
Ann was baking pies
Wendy’s dad exploded too
That might’ve been a lie

Pam had frisbee lessons
Stella had ballet
Now I’m by myself
But I can have fun anyway, so….

Dim the lights
Remove my tights 

YEAH! Nobody showed but I’m gonna have some fun
Let’s get this party started it’s an orgy for one
It’s me and my hand and it’s hotter than the sun
So break out the tissues it’s an orgy for one
I’m workin’ out my issues in an orgy for one

Margaret’s cat got nauseous
Jane was way too shy 
Steve was not invited because he was a guy

Claire was parasailing
Brooke said she was in space
But it doesn’t matter
Cause I’m rounding second base

All through the night
My grasp is tight OH

I’m beating so hard you’d think I was a drum
And I don’t even care it’s an orgy for one
I’m here all alone and I’m tuggin on my plums
It’s not just masturbation it’s an orgy for one
It’s a fuckin’ celebration it’s an orgy for one

Orgy for one
Orgy for one

Sixty nine 
Without the nine
Now pour the wine 
I’m mine all mine

I’m batting a thousand and nailing everyone
Thank you everybody at this orgy for one
These pillows are stacked to look vaguely like a butt
You know I’m goin for it, it’s an orgy for one

My junk is getting sore and it’s an orgy for one
You know that I’ll be scoring at the orgy for one

Orgy for one
Orgy for one",210.0,rec

LYRICS:
It was the year 2005, Youtube had just begun
So we made a video, just for fun
We lip synced the Pokemon theme, we thought it was alright
But randomly, some dick removed it, claiming copyright

POKEMON, YOU DON'T KNOW THE LAW
Why can't you see, it was a parody
POKEMON
Oh, you used to be cool, 'til you turned into a tool

POKEMON, YOU CAN GO TO HELL
It got tons of views, your legal team's full of n00bs
Mess with me and I'll teach you, 
POKEMON!

TRY TO SUE US NOW!
Try to sue us now!

Had 24 million views
The most viewed on YouTube's space
But the legal douches flagged it
Robbed our rightful place

Let's kick their ass, the time is right
There's no better team
Arm-in-arm we'll win the fight
It's always been our dream!

POKEMON, YOU DON'T KNOW THE LAW
Why can't you see, it was a parody
POKEMON
Oh, you used to be cool, 'til you turned into a tool

POKEMON, YOU CAN GO TO HELL
It got tons of views, your legal team's full of n00bs
Mess with me and I'll teach you,
POKEMON!

Try to sue us now!

POKEMON, YOU DON'T KNOW THE LAW
Why can't you see, it was a parody
POKEMON
Ooooh, you used to be cool, til you turned into a tool

POKEMON, YOU CAN GO TO HELL
It got tons of views, your legal team's full of noobs
Mess with me and I'll teach you
POKEMON!

TRY TO SUE US NOW!

Except this time, they're gonna be honest with you!
Thank you to everyone who was a part of this video and also..

Shout-out to the University of Nevada, Reno, whose beautiful
campus was shown at :12 into the video. The University of Nevada, Reno is
one of the most affordable national Tier 1 universities (students pay 72
percent less in tuition than kids at other Tier 1 universities), they
graduate with less debt (Nevada is ranked #6 for least student debt), and
Nevada graduates have starting salaries among the highest in the nation.
Oh, yeah, celebrity graduates include Colin Kaepernick of the San
Francisco 49ers and Susan Desmond-Hellman, CEO of the Bill & Melinda Gates
Foundation. So, Go Wolf Pack! and thanks for being good sports and letting
us use your campus in our video!

LYRICS:

Cinco de la mañana tú me llama
Solo pa ver quien está en mi cama
Yo no tengo tiempo pa tu drama
A mi no me llame a la cinco de la mañana

Porqué de seguro ando de rumba con mi hermana 
Tu quieres llamarme y solo cuando tienes ganas 
Me fui a bailar esta noche
Voy a disfrutar sin reproches

Te pones celoso
Si me ve con otro
Hago lo que quiero 
Solo me la gozo

Te pones celoso
Si bailo con otro
Yo no soy de ellos 
Ni tuya tampoco

Se que me celas
Y yo te veo
Y tu me miras 
Yo me meneo

Te pones celoso
Si bailo con otro
Hago lo que quiero
Solo me la gozo

Le hago 
rompompompom 
Tú quiere 
rompompompom 
Le hago
rompompompom
Tú quiere
rompompompom

No necesito que me pague a mi los tragos 
Eres intenso estás haciendo demasiado
Tiene dinero pero yo también trabajo
yo no pregunto, si lo quiero yo lo hago

Se que tú quieres probar mi piel
No soy de esas lo sabes bien 
Ya te lo dije más de una vez 
Que ya no voy a caer

Te pones celoso
Si me ve con otro 
Hago lo que quiero 
Solo me la gozo

Te pones celoso 
Si bailo con otro
Yo no soy de ellos 
Ni tuya tampoco

Se que me celas 
Y yo te veo
Y tu me miras 
Yo me meneo

Te pones celoso
Si bailo con otro 
Hago lo que quiero 
Solo me la gozo

Le hago
rompompompom
Tú quiere 
rompompompom
Le hago 
rompompompom 
Tú quiere 
rompompompom

Lyrics:

Quizas despues de ti yo termine siendo uno mas
Que no te enamoras, llegue yo a escuchar
Hay varias cosas que tenemos que intentar
Y queria aprovechar

Dame lo que quiero
Escuche que tu amor es pasajero
Pero me montaria en el vuelo
Y aunque se que esto es temporal
Tu eres lo que quiero
Escuche que eres fria como el hielo
Un angel que callo del cielo
Y entro a la maldad

Dicen que tu eres mala
De ti nadie se salva
Envuelves con tu cuerpo
Todos te tienen ganas
Dicen que tu eres mala
De ti nadie se salva
Y como una modelo
Todos te tienen ganas

El trafico para
Mientras cruce me miraban
Con ellos no quiero nada
Se lo digo con una mirada
Dicen que soy malvada
Y fria como el invierno
Ellos se mueren por un beso
Pero es dificil la jugada
Querias comprobar porque dicen que yo soy criminal
Vas a ver como esto va a terminar
Te queria contar que

Dicen que yo soy mala
De mi nadie se salva
Se que quieren mi cuerpo
De ellos no quiero nada

Dicen que tu eres mala
De ti nadie se salva
Y como una modelo
Todos te tienen ganas

Te quiero aunque no sea yo el primero Despacio que tu amor es muy ligero Permiteme un minuto mas Acostumbras a tratarlos mal
Pero creo que conmigo eso puede cambiar Pero solo

Dame lo que quiero
Escuche que tu amor es pasajero
Pero me montaria en el vuelo
Y aunque se que esto es temporal

Sabes lo que quiero
Muchos como tu yo he visto pasajero Haciendome subir del suelo
Por algo temporal

Dicen que yo soy mala
De mi nadie se salva
Se que quieren mi cuerpo
De ellos no quiero nada

Dicen que tu eres mala
De ti nadie se salva
Y como una modelo
Todos te tienen ganas

All original music belongs to One Direction. But these wonderful instrumentals were remade and mastered by:
Music by: Durrani Bros.
All Additional Instruments by: Paul Castro aka THE iDENTiTY CRiSiS (http://www.youtube.com/theidc)
And of course all the horrible singing was done by yours truly =) HEY! I DO COMEDY OKAY. 

Special thanks to Lindsey Stirling for the cameo, Humble the Poet for his amazing camera work and Symposium in Vaughan for letting us shoot in their awesome resto! 

--LYRICS--

-That's What Makes You Beautiful-
Your dress is short!
Don’t know what for!
Can see your knees when you walk through the door
Is that make up?
You wearing blush?
Go and change before I kick you in the butt!

Everyone kids dresses very proper
Everyone else but you….

Why don’t you wear all the clothes that I always get
like that nice scarf or the big pink turtleneck 
you wearing ten inch high heel and I bet
you don’t know
you look like a bloody mess

If only you saw what family sees
They don’t like big earrings, they like school degrees
only curve you should show is some round rotis
trust me I know….
that’s what makes you beautiful
ooo-ooo
that's what makes you beautiful!

-Story Of My Life-
Sitting in my backseat, are clothes that I have to change
I leave my house covered, put a dress on while I’m changing lanes
Mom told me when I left that I should be back home latest by nine
Seems to me that I’ll have to say my phone died and i lost track of time

And I’ll be gone, gone tonight
to meet my boyfriend, yeah I lied
Know I’m not supposed to talk to guys
But he’s just so damn fine…

The story of my life
i leave from home
In 10 minutes, I
hear my phone
It’s mom…I should have knownnnn…

The story of my life
I text my friend
I know my mom will call to just check in
Please lie. 
Say i’m in the washroom

-Steal My Girl-
She’s been my queen
since she was 16
she is my daughter
i am her papi ALRIGHT (ALRIGHT)

She is a doll
She do good in school
She never break rule
She always tell truth ALRIGHT (ALRIGHT)

I know, I know, I know for sure

Every boy want to steal my girl
Everybody want to call her late at night
But I am listening outside her door
and i know everything she does online

Everybody want to steal my girl
But she can’t lie to me you see
because i know her phone password
and always read her diary

Na na na na na na (oh, yeah)
Na na na na na na (alright)
Na na na na na na
Na na

She won’t lie to me! 

-Night Changes-
Going out tonight, changes into something else
My father doesn’t like that kind of dress
Everything you says to help, i’m blowing off

Calls from my mom, voice is screaming through the phone
She said just wait until I get home
Having no regrets it all I really want.

I’m only getting older damn it
it took 2 weeks for him to plan this
wanted one pic just to instagram it
I hate it when the night changes

Everything that I ever dreamed of
disappearing cause we break up
I’m not a kid dad, wont u wake up
how in hell did this night change up

Manjeet: you will never leave the house again.

It's time for Gordon to sample the menu. Nick serves him up a series of dishes, from fish soup to duck egg on toast, one of Gordon's favourites. However, Nick stupidly forgets that his scallops dish is Gordon's own recipe. Nick could be in for some tough criticism here.

Disney Doc McStuffins Deluxe Clinic and Vet Playset

Your child can send Squibbles and Lambie to the Disney Doc McStuffins Deluxe Clinic and Vet Playset for treatment. With this double-sided playset, Lambie can go into the clinic to see Doc, who can check her height on the scale. Doc can sit on the stool and test Lambie's reflexes with the knee hammer, then look at her ears with the otoscope. Squibbles can come to the pet vet part of the clinic in the dog carrier. Your little one can weigh him on the pet vet scale, then let him slide down the slide with Lambie. Add medicine to his dog bowl before he heads to sleep in the dog house or the pet bed. Your child can flip the clinic's table top and listen as Doc talks and sings, then send Doc to bed upstairs after a long day.
