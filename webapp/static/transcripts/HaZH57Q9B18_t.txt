 Hearthstone Heroes of Warcraft makes a fantastic first impression thanks to its elaborate satisfying card animations excellently paste unlockables and it's crazy high level of Polish and the more I lay blizzards virtual Trading Card Game the Mora Farm did deeper appreciation of its elegant class and card balance this is more than enough to overcome my small grumbles regarding its random nature and some of its missing options Hudson's Brilliance is that it doesn't rely on complex complicated rule interactions to create your sustain skilled play with a few exceptions card effects are self-explanatory and communicate their effects with just a few words and yet this is not a game or you and your opponent can just mindlessly smash cards together with the lucky or player coming out on top even a dead simple damage-dealing hard like Fireball has interesting situation of choices around it should you save it to take out an enemy minion combo it with another damage boosting spell or just attack your opponent directly these layers of thoughtful strategy timing and Mind Games create a game that is both accessible and has plenty of death blizzard also made a smart decision to split the 400 cards between nine playable classes based on the World of Warcraft archives morlocks can damage themselves to draw card if they bring an aggressive play style pre skin heal and so on this is some smartly nudges new Meyers closer to standard deck construction while still providing plenty of variety and flexibility for experts and it's a great way to connect to Warcraft lore unlike physical card games like magic the Gathering Hearthstone certain degree of Randomness can sometimes leave a few too many critical moments up to the gods of probability unpredictability does a detention but a random damage card that has a 10% chance to blow up in your face will sometimes blow up in your face and you will curse drawing the exact card you need to win at the exact moment you need it already feels like chance enough Hearthstone is a little heavy on random facts an enemy Mage top decking an ultra deadly pyroblast never leaves me frustrated for long though thanks for headstones incredible level of Polish and attention to detail the game just feels great cards have a wonderful physicality to them with powerful minions thinking loudly into the Playfield is smashing into opponents when they attack  listen to attention to detail is unparalleled every single Minion has a custom sound for coming into play attacking and diet  ultra rare legendary cards and mini spells have you been more elaborate animations it's flashing fun and represents an impressive level of care  a simple daily Quest system generally pays you enough currency to buy a new premium pack of cards roughly every other day if you do decide to spend money hot Stones v card packs cost around 125 to 150 each this currency can also be spent to enter headstones premium card drafting Arena mode wouldn't year is not easy since it's not free to enter But if you pull it off your exit with more gold than you entered this allows truly skilled players to play indefinitely without ever spending a sent however there is no card trading of any kind which is a major disappointment once you end up like me with most of the cars unlocked besides the ultra rare are legendaries you'll just open up pack after pack of duplicates looking for those few elusive cards needed to complete your set and be broken down and cracked need the exchange rate is disappointing and frustrating the irony is that I like Hearthstone more than enough to spend more money on it but there's nothing in game that I want to buy  Hudson's also missing a few key features most notably any form of tournament mode right now you can play using your pre-constructed decks and unranked to ranked play or challenge battle net friends too friendly fire and that's it the potential for hourly or nightly tournaments but at least giving players the ability to organize their own Turney's can't be overstated  it's always a good sign when a games only major downside is that there just isn't enough of it the elegant Simplicity of heart Stones rules it's impressive attention to detail and personality in the true viability playing completely for free make it easy to fall under its spell and get blissfully lost in the depth of its strategic possibilities but paradoxically the way the store works in the lack of a trading economy means it's easy to feel disappointed when you do spend money Hearthstone is an amazing trading card game today I've lost something like 1,000 matches and Counting a blizzard can deliver a steady stream of fresh content I'm down to log at least another 1000 in the months and years to come for more on Hearthstone in all things blizzard keep it locked IGN
