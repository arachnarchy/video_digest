DC's pantheon of heroes features some of the biggest names the genre has to offer: Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, The Flash, Green Lantern... and then there's everyone else. That being said, some of these unsung heroes may be overshadowed, but that doesn't mean they aren't interesting or capable. Here are some lesser known characters that are just as awesome as their mainstream counterparts.

LYRICS:
It was the year 2005, Youtube had just begun
So we made a video, just for fun
We lip synced the Pokemon theme, we thought it was alright
But randomly, some dick removed it, claiming copyright

POKEMON, YOU DON'T KNOW THE LAW
Why can't you see, it was a parody
POKEMON
Oh, you used to be cool, 'til you turned into a tool

POKEMON, YOU CAN GO TO HELL
It got tons of views, your legal team's full of n00bs
Mess with me and I'll teach you, 
POKEMON!

TRY TO SUE US NOW!
Try to sue us now!

Had 24 million views
The most viewed on YouTube's space

Lyrics:

Quizas despues de ti yo termine siendo uno mas
Que no te enamoras, llegue yo a escuchar
Hay varias cosas que tenemos que intentar
Y queria aprovechar

Dame lo que quiero
Escuche que tu amor es pasajero
Pero me montaria en el vuelo
Y aunque se que esto es temporal
Tu eres lo que quiero
Escuche que eres fria como el hielo
Un angel que callo del cielo
Y entro a la maldad

Dicen que tu eres mala
De ti nadie se salva
Envuelves con tu cuerpo
Todos te tienen ganas
Dicen que tu eres mala
De ti nadie se salva
Y como una modelo
Todos te tienen ganas

El trafico para
Mientras cruce me miraban
Con ellos no quiero nada
Se lo digo con una mirada
Dicen que soy malvada
Y fria como el invierno
Ellos se mueren por un beso
Pero es dificil la jugada
Querias comprobar porque dicen que yo soy criminal
Vas a ver como esto va a terminar
Te queria contar que

Dicen que yo soy mala
De mi nadie se salva
Se que quieren mi cuerpo
De ellos no quiero nada

Dicen que tu eres mala
De ti nadie se salva
Y como una modelo
Todos te tienen ganas

Te quiero aunque no sea yo el primero Despacio que tu amor es muy ligero Permiteme un minuto mas Acostumbras a tratarlos mal
Pero creo que conmigo eso puede cambiar Pero solo

Dame lo que quiero
Escuche que tu amor es pasajero
Pero me montaria en el vuelo
Y aunque se que esto es temporal

Sabes lo que quiero
Muchos como tu yo he visto pasajero Haciendome subir del suelo
Por algo temporal

Dicen que yo soy mala
De mi nadie se salva
Se que quieren mi cuerpo
De ellos no quiero nada

Dicen que tu eres mala
De ti nadie se salva
Y como una modelo
Todos te tienen ganas

Most people are taught that dinosaurs went extinct 66 million years ago when a giant meteor crashed into the Yucatan peninsula. I'm here to tell you that's wrong. Dinosaurs are alive and well today, and you don't have to go to Jurassic World to see them (although hanging out with Chris Pratt would be cool)
We have living dinosaurs all around us. We just call them ""birds"". Yes. Birds are dinosaurs.

Among living things, the color blue is oddly rare. Blue rocks, blue sky, blue water, sure. But blue animals? They are few and far between. And the ones that do make blue? They make it in some very strange and special ways compared to other colors. In this video, we'll look at some very cool butterflies to help us learn how living things make blue, and why this beautiful hue is so rare in nature.

Cells are the microscopic units that make up all life on earth! Some living things only have one cell, and many have more! There are many different types of cells that all do different jobs, but the basic structure of these cells are all very similar. Plant cells and animal cells share many of their parts, such as the cell membrane, nucleus, cytoplasm, ribosomes, endoplasmic reticulum, gogli apparatus, mitochondria and more.

In mythological ancient Greece, Icarus flew above Crete on wings made from wax and feathers, defying the laws of man and nature. To witnesses on the ground, he looked like a god, and he felt like one too. But, in his society, the line that separated god from man was absolute, and the punishment for mortals who attempted to cross it was severe. Amy Adkins explains the myth of Icarus and Daedalus.

As with most comic book characters, there are often re-imaginings and different versions to a character’s past. We have chosen primarily to follow the storyline which unfolded in 1959's The Brave and the Bold #25 which was expanded upon in 1986's Legends #1 and 3, 1987's Secret origins #14 and 2008's Suicide Squad #4-5.

Gordon is interested to see what Oscar's menu has to offer, but finds himself waiting over 30 minutes for the main course. He should consider himself lucky though, the girls behind him have been waiting over two hours for their meals. 

You're a restaurant owner in crisis, the wolves are at the door, but the customers aren't. You've got temperamental chefs in the kitchen, lazy waiting staff and the diners you do have aren't satisfied. Desperate for restaurant resuscitation? Call in the restaurant trade's equivalent of the Emergency Services - the inimitable, indomitable Gordon Ramsay.

The Great Wall of China is a monumental landmark in China and the longest structure ever built by humans. Construction on it started more than two thousand years ago and continued, off and on, for almost a thousand years until 1644. Did you know the Great Wall cannot actually be seen from the moon? However, if you were in a low enough orbit and new exactly where and how to look, you might be able to see it.

But this self-investigation is challenging because a living brain is shielded by skull, swaddled in tissue, and made up of billions of tiny cells. How do we study living brains without harming their owners? Elizabeth Waters and John Brorghi explain how EEGs, fMRIs, and PETs work.

About this Doc McStuffins Toy!

Disney Doc McStuffins Deluxe Clinic and Vet Playset

Your child can send Squibbles and Lambie to the Disney Doc McStuffins Deluxe Clinic and Vet Playset for treatment. With this double-sided playset, Lambie can go into the clinic to see Doc, who can check her height on the scale. Doc can sit on the stool and test Lambie's reflexes with the knee hammer, then look at her ears with the otoscope. Squibbles can come to the pet vet part of the clinic in the dog carrier. Your little one can weigh him on the pet vet scale, then let him slide down the slide with Lambie. Add medicine to his dog bowl before he heads to sleep in the dog house or the pet bed. Your child can flip the clinic's table top and listen as Doc talks and sings, then send Doc to bed upstairs after a long day.

We wanted to put assumptions to the test to see what we're missing out on because we're so busy assuming we already ""know"" a person. Join us as we discover why you should never judge a book by it’s cover in our series, Reverse Assumptions.

We are all conditioned with certain biases. In this experiment, we challenged these biases by asking people to make assumptions about their partner's appearance without ever actually seeing their partner. When they flipped around to finally face each other, they were shocked by how wrong they were.

Now it's YOUR turn. What do people assume about you?

Since the days of Ancient Greece, philosophers and scientists have been wondering: What is space? Is the absence of things… a thing? These questions continued to fascinate physicists in the modern era, leading Isaac Newton, Ernst Mach, and Albert Einstein to wonder about the true nature of the fabric of the cosmos. The search for an answer led them to some of the greatest theories in physics. This week, we ask if space and time are really real, and how they come together to make “spacetime”!

We wanted to put assumptions to the test to see what we're missing out on because we're so busy assuming we already ""know"" a person. Join us as we discover why you should never judge a book by it’s cover in our series, Reverse Assumptions.

We are all conditioned with certain biases. In this experiment, we challenged these biases by asking people to make assumptions about their partner's appearance without ever actually seeing their partner. When they flipped around to finally face each other, they were shocked by how wrong they were.

Now it's YOUR turn. What do people assume about you?

[Stay tuned for another 60 sec. specimen story TOMORROW!]

Before he was charged and convicted with the murder of 14-year-old Bobby Franks, Nathan Leopold was an active birder in the Chicago community. After his conviction and sentencing he donated his collection of birds and published checklists to the Field Museum, where they remain today. 

Kirtland's Warblers (Setophaga kirtlandii) are relatively rare birds, and back in the 1920's little was known about their migration behavior or life histories. This specimen remains important today -- not just for its historical significance in connection with a convicted murderer -- but for the scientific value it provides as a voucher specimen for research.

View full lesson: https://ed.ted.com/lessons/why-do-you-need-to-get-a-flu-shot-every-year-melvin-sanicas

All year long, researchers at hospitals around the world collect samples from flu patients and send them to top virology experts with one goal: to design the vaccine for the next flu season. But why do we need a new one every year? Vaccines for diseases like mumps and rubella offer a lifetime of protection with two shots early in life; what’s so special about the flu? Melvin Sanicas explains.

We've heard news of ""peak oil"" and ""the end of the oil age"" for years now, but we keep coming up with ways to find and pump more of it to the surface. Rising CO2 levels and the changing climate that results from burning fossil fuels mean that we should probably stop using oil sooner rather than later, though
Let's take a look at history and see how we've used different fuels, so that we might figure out when and how to make oil a thing of the past

In addition to academic stress, there's a LOT of social pressure. Girls tend to have more drama and hold on to things for much longer than boys. There’s also a lot of pressure to look perfect, to wear the right clothes and hang with the right clique. Also, we report on ways to avoid being a victim. In middle school, kids develop new ways to hurt each other and, unfortunately, much of that has to do with exclusion and not allowing people to be in your group. “Girl Talk” is an organization that aims to help. It is a student to student mentoring program where high school girls mentor middle school girls. The founder of “Girl Talk” offers some good advice for girls in middle school.

Psyche was born so beautiful that she was worshipped as a new incarnation of Venus, the goddess of love. But human lovers were too intimidated to approach her, and Apollo recommended her father abandon her on a crag where she would marry “a cruel and savage, serpent-like winged evil.” But Psyche’s story ended up being much more interesting. Brendan Pelsue shares the myth of Cupid and Psyche.

Sexual harassment is teasing or touching in any way that makes a person feel uncomfortable. The AAUW, the American Association of University Women, found that in one school year about half of all the students had encountered some form of harassment. Sexual harassment can happen to anyone, anywhere. In fact, one in three students reports that they have been harassed through a text, email or Facebook. Unfortunately, it was found that only half the students who were victimized reported it. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court has ruled that schools must take steps to stop harassment. Schools are required to set up policies to make clear that harassment will not be tolerated. Teens are urged to talk to somebody if they are being harassed.

You're a restaurant owner in crisis, the wolves are at the door, but the customers aren't. You've got temperamental chefs in the kitchen, lazy waiting staff and the diners you do have aren't satisfied. Desperate for restaurant resuscitation? Call in the restaurant trade's equivalent of the Emergency Services - the inimitable, indomitable Gordon Ramsay. 

Each week in Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares, a struggling restaurant receives the Gordon Ramsay treatment. With only a couple of weeks to turn around its flagging fortunes, nothing is sacred. There's no time for polite small talk as Gordon reveals a few home truths to the exhausted, emotional restaurant owner or manager and embarks upon his mission to turn things around.

We wanted to put assumptions to the test to see what we're missing out on because we're so busy assuming we already ""know"" a person. Join us as we discover why you should never judge a book by it’s cover in our series, Reverse Assumptions.

We are all conditioned with certain biases. In this experiment, we challenged these biases by asking people to make assumptions about their partner's appearance without ever actually seeing their partner. When they flipped around to finally face each other, they were shocked by how wrong they were.

Now it's YOUR turn. What do people assume about you?

* Lon Chaney Senior is known as one of the greatest actors of the silent era of film. But did you know that he also did all his own elaborate makeup when he played grotesque villains who were scarred, mutilated or paralyzed? See, Chaney was raised by parents who were both deaf and mute, so he was already skilled in the art of pantomime when he got to Hollywood. He enhanced this by altering his flesh with cotton, wires and even fish skin. The best tool in Chaney’s arsenal was a viscous liquid called collodion that appeared like scarred skin. He employed all of these tricks in his masterful performance as the Phantom of the Opera, going so far as to give himself nosebleeds from a wire that made turned up his nose. Chaney was such a master of makeup that he was asked to write the entry on it for the 14th edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica. 
* Remember in “The Exorcist” when young Linda Blair transforms into a vomiting demon whose head spins around 360 degrees? We can thank Dick Smith for that monstrosity. He built a fiberglass version of Blair’s head for the scene. What’s even more impressive is that Smith also made then 44-year old Max von Sydow appear to be 74 years old in the same film! Over 40 years later, von Sydow’s finally starting to catch up to Smith’s aging effects. Smith also aged Dustin Hoffman 100 years in “Little Big Man” and gave Marlon Brando his infamous jowls in “The Godfather.” He won an Academy Award in 1984 for “Amadeus” and received a lifetime honorary award in 2011. Thanks to Smith’s developments, the industry now uses a more realistic technique of layering facial molds as separate prosthetics, instead of just having an actor wear a mask.
* One of Smith’s assistants on “The Exorcist” was Rick Baker, who went on to create the horrifying transformation scene in “An American Werewolf in London.” No CGI was used to pull this off. It was all makeup and animatronics. Baker won an Oscar for his work, the first “achievement in makeup and hairstyling.”  He also helped populate the cantina in “Star Wars,” designed the 1976 King Kong and raised the dead for Michael Jackson’s “Thriller” video.
* Another protege of Smith’s is Stan Winston, who has won multiple Oscars and designed makeup effects for “Aliens,” “Terminator,” “Predator” and “Edward Scissorhands.” In “Terminator 2,” Winston designed a fiberglass replica of Robert Patrick’s head that would spring open. This was used in the scene where the T-1000 reforms after being blown apart by a shotgun. Winston’s so dedicated he even built full-scale animatronic dinosaurs for the original “Jurassic Park.”
* As Baker was a student of Smith, he in turn passed his knowledge down to artist Rob Bottin. Hired at age 14, Bottin learned on the set of “Star Wars” before going on to create effects for “Robocop,” “Total Recall,” “The Thing” and “The Howling.” In that last picture, Bottin glued inflatable sacs to the actors faces to show them transforming into werewolves. And in “Total Recall,” he made a malformed puppet of actress Rachel Ticotin to simulate her head decompressing on the surface of Mars. During work on John Carpenter’s horror classic “The Thing,” Bottin worked so hard that he was hospitalized with exhaustion, double pneumonia and a bleeding ulcer. Oh… and he was only 21 at the time!",337.0,edu

The category of dwarf planets was created in 2006 by the International Astronomical Union to help contain new objects that were being discovered. Although there are hundreds of objects in the solar system that could potentially be classified as dwarf planets, as of 2017 there are only five officially recognized ones: Ceres, Pluto, Eris, Haumea, and Makemake. Unlike planets, dwarf planets have not cleared their orbits of objects and debris.

The human brain is one of the most sophisticated organs in the world, a supercomputer made of billions of neurons that control all of our senses, thoughts, and actions. But there was something Charles Darwin found even more impressive: the brain of an ant, which he called “one of the most marvelous atoms of matter in the world.” Anna Stöckl takes us inside the tiny but mighty insect brain.

In this episode of The Science of Empathy, we compare the effects of sympathy vs. empathy on one’s happiness.

We wanted to put assumptions to the test to see what we're missing out on because we're so busy assuming we already ""know"" a person. Join us as we discover why you should never judge a book by it’s cover in our series, Reverse Assumptions.

We are all conditioned with certain biases. In this experiment, we challenged these biases by asking people to make assumptions about their partner's appearance without ever actually seeing their partner. When they flipped around to finally face each other, they were shocked by how wrong they were.

Now it's YOUR turn. What do people assume about you?

From spirals to spots to fractals, nature is full of interesting patterns. Many of these patterns even resemble geometric shapes. One of the most common? Hexagons. Why do we see this six-sided shape occur so many times in nature? This week we explore why hexagons are so common in the natural world, from honeycomb to bubbles to rocks, and what their mathematics, physics, and biology may have in common.

Living things have engineered some pretty awesome materials, but I'm not sure anything measures up to spider silk. It's as strong, as stretchy, and as resilient than even humans' most advanced creations like Kevlar and steel. So how do these awesome arachnids weave such an incredible substance using nothing but their rear ends? And… what IS this stuff? I went to meet Dr. Cheryl Hayashi, one of the world's experts in spider silk, to find out.

In ‘The Pangaea Pop-up’ Lesson, animator Biljana Labovic decided the best way to illustrate moving, shifting tectonic plates was to use a physical object that could also move and shift. Here, Labovic explains how she and her team of animators created a pop-up book to visualize Pangaea -- and how you can make your own.

The marriage of Orpheus, the greatest of all poets and musicians, to Eurydice, a wood nymph, was heralded as the perfect union. Anyone could tell the couple was deeply in love. So when their wedding ceremony ended in Eurydice's untimely death, Orpheus had no choice but to venture into the underworld to try to reclaim his lost love. Brendan Pelsue shares the tragic myth of Orpheus and Eurydice.

Glacier ice is weird. It’s solid. Solid things aren’t supposed to flow. But glacier ice flows like a liquid, and it does that without melting! How is this possible? I traveled to Mendenhall Glacier in Juneau, Alaska to find out.

Twenty dollars is a lot of money...well, maybe not that much. But how much of that money would you be willing to share with another person? How would they feel if they were your spouse, cousin or maybe even a total stranger? On the premiere episode of The Science of Empathy, we investigate the ability to feel what others are feeling with a little game. We gathered strangers, couples, friends, and family alike for our premiere experiment in the Science of Empathy. What cut of the twenty dollars would you give away, when you consider someone else’s feelings?

Thank you to everyone who was a part of this video and also..

Shout-out to the University of Nevada, Reno, whose beautiful
campus was shown at :12 into the video. The University of Nevada, Reno is
one of the most affordable national Tier 1 universities (students pay 72
percent less in tuition than kids at other Tier 1 universities), they
graduate with less debt (Nevada is ranked #6 for least student debt), and
Nevada graduates have starting salaries among the highest in the nation.
Oh, yeah, celebrity graduates include Colin Kaepernick of the San
Francisco 49ers and Susan Desmond-Hellman, CEO of the Bill & Melinda Gates
Foundation. So, Go Wolf Pack! and thanks for being good sports and letting
us use your campus in our video!

523,TiYIiQKG4NA, amphibians do not have scaly skin instead their skin is usually smooth and moist  the word amphibian means to lives because all amphibians spend at least part of their lives in the water and part of their lives on land  in the water is usually where amphibians lay their eggs they don't look much like the eggs you can find in your kitchen that is because amphibian eggs do not have shells instead they are enclosed by a delicate membrane that are often protected by a substance that looks like jelly  Wendy's eggs hatch the young won't look much like their parents that's because just like a caterpillar turning into a butterfly young amphibians have to make a big change called a metamorphosis before reaching adulthood,0.9655587673187256,UCebMFnw6WxozGmqGekJHOJg,"All About Amphibians: Tadpoles, Frogs, and Salamanders - Freeschool",Frog (Animal) Amphibian (Animal) Salamander (Animal) newt tadpole metamorphosis Toad (Animal) freeschool freeschool animal amphibians for kids what makes an amphibian learn about amphibians amphibians characteristics what is an amphibian amphibian documentary amphibian lesson,"https://patreon.com/freeschool - Help support more content like this!
Amphibians are cool! Aside from some fish, amphibians are the only vertebrates to undergo metamorphosis. (That means a big change or transformation - just think about tadpoles turning into frogs!) They're cold-blooded, they live in water and on land, and they are almost everywhere. Amphibians are cool!

Before the creation of humanity, the Greek gods won a great battle against a race of giants called the Titans. Most Titans were destroyed or driven to the eternal hell of Tartarus. But the Titan Prometheus, whose name means foresight, persuaded his brother Epimetheus to fight with him on the side of the Gods. Iseult Gillespie shares the myth of Prometheus.

When they flipped around to finally face each other, they were shocked by how wrong they were.

Now it's YOUR turn. What do people assume about you?

Kamau Bell in an extended episode.

Dive into Bourdain's world: https://explorepartsunknown.com/

Following are the locations and episode descriptions for the new season:

Kenya (season 12 premiere: September 23 – special extended episode 9pm-10:15pm ET)   Bourdain introduces his fellow CNN Original Series host W. Kamau Bell (United Shades of America) to the distinctive sights, tastes, and sounds of Kenya.  It is Bell’s first trip to the African continent, and to a country that holds a personal connection for him. In Nairobi, they talk to locals about the country’s growth and economic challenges, as well as the continual fight for identity and self-definition of Kenyans.  Bourdain and Bell also take a Matatu party bus ride, share a meal of goat’s head soup and visit a boxing academy devoted to teaching young women, and promoting female empowerment. Leaving Nairobi the pair travel to Lewa Wildlife Conservancy and visit with a Maasai community actively engaged in conservation.  Through the eyes of Bourdain and Bell, and their first experiences with this highly dynamic deeply, soulful and beautiful country we ask, what will a future Kenya… for Kenyans…. by Kenyans…look like?

Asturias, Spain (September 30) Bourdain travels to the enchanted region of Asturias, Spain with chef and humanitarian Jose Andres, as he makes a return to his homeland.  The people of Asturias embody the rugged environment of the region with a hard working ‘do it yourself’ spirit. Bourdain and Andres hike to a remote village in the mountains for traditional fabada, ocean cliffs for gooseneck barnacles, and secret cheese caves in undisclosed locations.  Bourdain also enjoys pitu de caleya with local musician Pablo Und Destruktion while he’s served on the last worker’s class movement. And in true Jose Andres form, he saves a special surprise for the end.

Indonesia (October 7 ) A shadow puppet performance provides an entry into understanding Indonesia, a country comprised of thousands of islands whose people endured political turmoil, and one in which, Bourdain discovers, food is the great unifier. In this fourth largest country in the world, every area has it’s own unique traditions. In Jakarta, Bourdain eats at a Padang Restaurant where nearly every menu item comes to the table; while in Bali he visits the beach, commenting on yoga before joining in a traditional Balinese Funeral ceremony.

Bourdain’s Impact (October 14) This episode explores how Anthony Bourdain’s unique perspective and voice altered the world of food, travel and culture and in the process reinvented how audiences watched television and engaged intimately and actively with the world around them.

Far West Texas (October 21) Bourdain travels to the untamed land of Big Bend, Texas near the Mexican border; an area that pits man against nature and in which the land usually wins. Bourdain shares meals with working cowboys who have made peace with the rough terrain, and meets with an anthropologist who decoded prehistoric landmark, the White Shaman wall painting.

Behind the Scenes (October 28) Bourdain’s relationship with his crew, the team that traveled with him and slogged through the trenches, was like no other in his life. In this episode the people who made Parts Unknown select moments from their episodes and pull back the curtain, to talk about collaboration, creative freedom, moments when Bourdain had their back or called them out, the times when he was caught off guard or forgot the cameras were even there.   

Lower East Side (November 11 special extended episode 9pm-10:15pm ET) Bourdain takes a personal journey through this formerly bohemian New York City neighborhood, as he meets, shares meals and reflects with music, film and art trailblazers including Richard Hell, Deborah Harry and Chris Stein, Lydia Lunch, Fab 5 Freddy, Danny Fields, Amos Poe, Jim Jarmusch, Kembra Pfahler, John Lurie, Clayton Patterson and Harley Flanagan, whose collective cultural  impact in the 1970’s and ’80’s has sustained through the decades.",292.0,edu

Jekyll and mr. Hyde but this idea didn't hold up when doctors and scientists examine patients who were missing a hemisphere or had their two hemispheres separated these patients showed a complete range of behaviors both logical and creative,0.9754005074501038,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA,The left brain vs. right brain myth - Elizabeth Waters,TED TED-Ed TED Education TED Ed Elizabeth Waters Daniel Gray brain neuroscience psychology left brain right brain creativity logic reflex Paul Broca Carl Wernicke Dr. Jekyll Mr. Hyde Robert Louis Stevenson cortex vision Broca's area temporal lobe,"View full lesson: https://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-left-brain-vs-right-brain-myth-elizabeth-waters

The human brain is visibly split into a left and right side. This structure has inspired one of the most pervasive ideas about the brain: that the left side controls logic and the right side controls creativity. And yet, this is a myth, unsupported by scientific evidence. So how did this idea come about, and what does it get wrong? Elizabeth Waters looks into this long held misconception.

We wanted to put assumptions to the test to see what we're missing out on because we're so busy assuming we already ""know"" a person. Join us as we discover why you should never judge a book by it’s cover in our series, Reverse Assumptions.

We are all conditioned with certain biases. In this experiment, we challenged these biases by asking people to make assumptions about their partner's appearance without ever actually seeing their partner. When they flipped around to finally face each other, they were shocked by how wrong they were.

Now it's YOUR turn. What do people assume about you?

Pennywhistle Productions/Smarter Every Day

Chickens have a great ability to keep their heads stable.  Our bodies use a gyro-like mechanism in our ears which has 3 mutually orthogonal inertial measurement devices.  Modern motion processors use something called an Inertial Measurment Unit (IMU).  These devices provide movement data which can be used to compensate for the movement.  Chickens apparently have the same type mechanism only with a higher update rate.

*Update* The chickens were eaten by the family dog.  WHOOPS!  :(

*Update #2* Sis and I are shot a music video. If you're interested search for ""Briley brand new key""

*Update #3*
Currently under non-exclusive license to be played on Fuji-TV in Japan.  Ha Ha.  Who would have thought?

*Update #4* July 10th, 2009   1 MILLION HITS Woo Hoo!

* Update #5 Sep 25th 2013  This idea was used in a commercial by Mercedes: ""Mercedes-Benz TV: MAGIC BODY CONTROL TV commercial ""

~~~~~~~~ German / Deutsch  courtesy of Bursaap ~~~~~
Hühner haben eine bermerkenswertige Fähigkeit ihre Köpfe stabil zu halten. Unsere Körper benutzen ein gyroskopisches Mechanismus das drei gegenseitige senkrechte biomechanische Inertialsensore. Moderne bewegungs Prozessoren benutzen einen sogennanten Inertial Measurement Unit, eine art Inertialsensor. Diese Geräte geben Daten an so dass es möglich ist die Bewegnung auszugleichen. Hühner haben anscheinend das selbe Biomechanismus aber mit höhreren aktualisierungs Häufigkeit.
*Update* Die Hühner wurden bei dem Familienhund gefressen! OOOPS 

*Update #2* Meine Schwester und Ich haben ein Musikvideo aufgenommen. Wenn es Sie interresiert suchen Sie ""Briley brand new key""

*Update #3*
Dieses Video wird in Japan auf Fuji-TV Spielen. Ha Ha. Wer hätte es gedacht?

*Update #4* July 10th, 2009 Eine Million hits! Geil!

Instead of saving for my kids' college, I make videos using the money I would have saved.
The thought is it will help educate the world as a whole, and one day generate enough revenue to pay for their education.  Until then if you appreciate what you've learned in this video and the effort that went in to it, please share the video.

What is an ecosystem? An ecosystem is everything that interacts in a specific area. That includes plants, animals, sun, air, water, and even rocks! In a healthy ecosystem, every part gets what they need - food, water, shelter, light - and all of the parts work together. Unfortunately, an ecosystem can become unbalanced through natural or manmade disturbances. The good news? Ecosystems can recover if we just help them out a little!

We all know that some things are alive, and some things are NOT alive, but have you ever thought about what makes something alive or not alive? Living things are called organisms, and anything from a blue whale to a spot of mold can be a living organism! Believe it or not, there is some scientific disagreement about what exact characteristics make something living or nonliving, but the four criteria in this video will help you make the right call the majority of the time.

We wanted to put assumptions to the test to see what we're missing out on because we're so busy assuming we already ""know"" a person. Join us as we discover why you should never judge a book by it’s cover in our series, Reverse Assumptions.

We are all conditioned with certain biases. In this experiment, we challenged these biases by asking people to make assumptions about their partner's appearance without ever actually seeing their partner. When they flipped around to finally face each other, they were shocked by how wrong they were.

Now it's YOUR turn. What do people assume about you?

We hear from a group of boys as they express what makes middle school difficult for them. Their answers varied from academic challenges to social issues. Many boys feel under pressure to be fast, strong and athletic. Middle school boys must also deal with their peers’ sometimes insulting and making fun of them. Plus Scott gives us some ways boys can deal with the challenges of middle school.  Things that can help are:   take advantage of the different activities and clubs offered in middle school; or even consider starting your own club. Scott also explores the difficulty boys have dealing with girls in middle school.

The Insider - ""A Difficult Subject""

Transcript:

You’ve probably heard a lot about gluten in the news. It’s the stuff that makes bread chewy, a protein formed by two chemicals, glutenin and gliadin. Humans have been eating it for at least 10,000 years, and it’s one of the most heavily consumed proteins on Earth. Recently gluten has become the latest nutritional boogeyman. Anti-gluten evangelists claim it causes everything from obesity to cancer. Medical and nutritional experts take a dim view of many of those claims. Here are 3 of the biggest gluten myths they’re trying to debunk.

1. Lots of People Are Gluten-intolerant 

Actually, it's only a small number. About 1% of the U.S. population has celiac disease, an autoimmune disorder that injures the small intestine and prevents patients from absorbing other nutrients from food when they ingest gluten. It can cause awful side effects, from gastrointestinal distress and chronic fatigue to anemia. Additionally, another 6% of the American public may have a controversial condition called non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS). Even for some people with NCGS, gluten may not be the real problem. In a 2013 study, researchers found that when excluding a broad class of nutrients called FODMAPS − which includes everything from fructose to bananas and asparagus – from NCGS patients’ diets, they stopped having gastrointestinal distress, even when they ate gluten.

2. To Avoid Gluten, You Need to Buy Special Food 

OK, so maybe you need to stay away from gluten because of celiac disease or NCGS. Or maybe you're just convinced that gluten is bad for you. Companies that manufacture gluten-free foods can’t wait to meet – and overcharge - you. A bag of gluten-free chocolate chip cookies, for example, may cost close to five times as much as the regular kind. But you don't need to buy a $13 bag of cookies or a $6 loaf of bread to avoid gluten. A lot of foods naturally don't have any gluten in them, including fruits, vegetables, meats, poultry, fish, nuts, milk, most cheeses and yogurt, herbs, spices, and oils, butter, margarines, rice, certain cereals, and corn tortillas.

3. It's Possible to Live Completely Gluten-free 

Eating a 100% gluten-free diet may be theoretically possible, but according to National Foundation for Celiac Awareness president Alice Bast ""in reality, it's nearly an impossible feat.” The FDA actually allows products to be labeled gluten-free, even if they contain up to 20 parts per million. Further, the FDA doesn't actually require food manufacturers to test their finished products for gluten content. The FDA reassures people with celiac disease that all this probably doesn't put them at too much risk, since research shows that most of them can tolerate extremely small amounts of gluten. But for those who believe that gluten is an intolerable poison that must be avoided in any amount, the reality is going to be difficult to swallow.

What do you think? Are people exaggerating the dangers of gluten, or ignoring a very real danger? Let me know in the comments below, and for more info, check out our article 10 Myths About Gluten at HowStuffWorks.com.",266.0,edu

It’s been estimated that 1 in 10 works of fine art are forged or misattributed. The truth is, no one really knows how much fake art is out there, because many art counterfeiters are so skilled that their paintings are almost indistinguishable from the real works. But even counterfeiters can’t beat physics! From atomic bomb remnants to ancient atoms, here’s some of the amazing ways that science can detect fake art.

Mastering any physical skill takes practice. Practice is the repetition of an action with the goal of improvement, and it helps us perform with more ease, speed, and confidence. But what does practice actually do to make us better at things? Annie Bosler and Don Greene explain how practice affects the inner workings of our brains.

The moon changes its shape almost every night. But why? The phases of the moon are caused by the light from the sun and the moon's orbit around the Earth. From new moon through waxing crescent, quarter, gibbous, full moon, and waning back to new moon again, come learn about the cycle of shapes the moon takes (or rather, appears to take) as it travels around our planet.

Have you ever wondered why Mount Rushmore was built? (To honor American history and get people to visit South Dakota!) Or how Mount Rushmore was built? (Lots and lots of dynamite!) Mount Rushmore National Memorial is a famous American landmark. The faces of four influential presidents were carved into the side of a mountain using dynamite! The faces are about 60 feet high, the height of a six-story building, and are maintained by trained mountain climbers.

--LYRICS--

-That's What Makes You Beautiful-
Your dress is short!
Don’t know what for!
Can see your knees when you walk through the door
Is that make up?
You wearing blush?
Go and change before I kick you in the butt!

Everyone kids dresses very proper
Everyone else but you….

Why don’t you wear all the clothes that I always get
like that nice scarf or the big pink turtleneck 
you wearing ten inch high heel and I bet
you don’t know
you look like a bloody mess

If only you saw what family sees
They don’t like big earrings, they like school degrees
only curve you should show is some round rotis
trust me I know….
that’s what makes you beautiful
ooo-ooo
that's what makes you beautiful!

-Story Of My Life-
Sitting in my backseat, are clothes that I have to change
I leave my house covered, put a dress on while I’m changing lanes
Mom told me when I left that I should be back home latest by nine
Seems to me that I’ll have to say my phone died and i lost track of time

And I’ll be gone, gone tonight
to meet my boyfriend, yeah I lied
Know I’m not supposed to talk to guys
But he’s just so damn fine…

The story of my life
i leave from home
In 10 minutes, I
hear my phone
It’s mom…I should have knownnnn…

The story of my life
I text my friend
I know my mom will call to just check in
Please lie. 
Say i’m in the washroom

-Steal My Girl-
She’s been my queen
since she was 16
she is my daughter
i am her papi ALRIGHT (ALRIGHT)

She is a doll
She do good in school
She never break rule
She always tell truth ALRIGHT (ALRIGHT)

I know, I know, I know for sure

Every boy want to steal my girl
Everybody want to call her late at night
But I am listening outside her door
and i know everything she does online

Everybody want to steal my girl
But she can’t lie to me you see
because i know her phone password
and always read her diary

Na na na na na na (oh, yeah)
Na na na na na na (alright)
Na na na na na na
Na na

She won’t lie to me! 

-Night Changes-
Going out tonight, changes into something else
My father doesn’t like that kind of dress
Everything you says to help, i’m blowing off

Calls from my mom, voice is screaming through the phone
She said just wait until I get home
Having no regrets it all I really want.

I’m only getting older damn it
it took 2 weeks for him to plan this
wanted one pic just to instagram it
I hate it when the night changes

Everything that I ever dreamed of
disappearing cause we break up
I’m not a kid dad, wont u wake up
how in hell did this night change up

Manjeet: you will never leave the house again.

It's commonly known as Big Ben, but this famous  landmark is actually named Elizabeth Tower in honor of Queen Elizabeth II. It's more than 150 years old, 300 feet high, and has four clock faces each 23 feet across. It's famously accurate, and it's kept that way by stacking and unstacking pennies on its pendulum!

Mel Rosenberg dives into the stinky science of body odor.

___________

The Onin War tore Japan apart, but also kicked off the Sengoku Jidai or Warring States Period that's a seminal part of Japanese history. The power of the shogun dissolved and regional clan leaders or daimyo fought for control of the country. In the mid 16th century, near Kyoto, a clan called the Matsudaira found itself pinched between two great rivals: the Oda and the Imagawa. Abducted as a hostage by the Oda, the scion of the Matsudaira clan (the young Tokugawa Ieyasu) grew up to fight alongside of the Imagawa when he was released. Their combined forces threatened to destroy the entire Oda clan, but Oda Nobunaga had a different idea. They clashed at the Battle of Okehazama.

It was long assumed that Amazons, the fierce and fearsome women warriors of Greece, were imaginary. But curiously enough, stories from ancient Egypt, Persia, the Middle East, Central Asia, India and China also featured Amazon-like warrior women. And Amazons were described in ancient historical accounts, not just myths. Who were the real women warriors known as Amazons? Adrienne Mayor investigates.

A solar eclipse is one of the most dramatic astronomical events it is possible to witness. They are caused by the shadow of the moon falling on the Earth when the sun, moon, and Earth are aligned correctly. To the people within the moon's shadow, the sun appears to disappear and the sky goes dark.

We wanted to put assumptions to the test to see what we're missing out on because we're so busy assuming we already ""know"" a person. Join us as we discover why you should never judge a book by it’s cover in our series, Reverse Assumptions.

We are all conditioned with certain biases. In this experiment, we challenged these biases by asking people to make assumptions about their partner's appearance without ever actually seeing their partner. When they flipped around to finally face each other, they were shocked by how wrong they were.

Field Museum scientists and their collaborators came across this 1984 Ford Bronco parked on the side of the road in Puerto Rico during a research expedition. They were looking for lichens: plant-like organisms that are comprised of a symbiotic relationship between an algae, and a fungus. After trying to figure out how to get the entire vehicle back to the Field in Chicago, they settled on taking the door. Today, we're still learning new things about the lichens that call this rusty door home.

LYRICS

Once upon a time, there was a little fella named Cuphead.
He and his brother had a bit of a gambling problem, and things got kind of out of hand.
The sleazy townsfolk met together that night to discuss the problem,
knowing that Cuphead would soon be coming for them…

You’ve all probably heard the rumors-
-about this plucky little fella named Cuphead-
-He’s coming to collect on our deals with The Devil-
-and we need to stop him!

Hey! He’s comin’ this way, so beware!
Say, let’s shoot him right out of the air!
I could put him on icing myself!
And we three veggies won’t be so good for his health!

Let’s just smash him!
Or whack him with a trout!
We could thrash him-
And then pour his insides out!

We’re gonna kill off Cuphead!
We’re gonna make him die!
We’re gonna kill off Cuphead
with a big goodbye!

We’re gonna kill off Cuphead!
We’re gonna make him pay!
His debt to the Devil
is coming due today!

Ooo, just wait’ll I get my wings on that Cuphead!
I’d like to chip his china…

I’ll see that his life is cut short!
While I call in the cops to come bee support!
Why not give him the ride of his life!
Then shank that shnook with a briar sharp as a knife!

Let’s use science!
And arm ourselves for war!
Sky-high violence-
-is what Cuphead has in store!

We’re gonna kill off Cuphead!
We’re gonna make him die!
We’re gonna make him fish food!
And zen ve’ll make him fry!

We’re gonna kill off Cuphead!
We’re gonna make him pay!
His debt to the Devil
is coming due today!

One shift of the stars,
and the tide is sure to turn!
Too bad
Cuphead’s about to lose big!
Three heads will hunt him
till Cuphead feels the burn
For the rest of his
headlining gig!

They call me King Dice, cause that’s who I am!
A royal pain whose diabolical plan
to close some contracts needs a sucker or two.
So come on, Cuphead! Kid, I’m talking to you!
Come shake my hand!
We got a deal?
Good, cause now it gets real…

You agreed to my game and you lost! 
You accepted the odds, now you’ll cough up the cost!
Don’t screw with me kid, or I swear
I’ll take my tea from your skull like cheap chinaware!

Scare him!

Scorch him!
Let’s liquify his brains!
Taze him!
Torch him!
And then bury his remains!

We’re gonna kill off Cuphead!
We’re gonna make him die!
It’s his final curtain!
And the end is nigh!

We’re gonna kill off Cuphead!
We’re gonna make him pay!
His debt to the Devil
Is coming due today! (x5)

And they all live happily ever after! Wait, no they didn’t.
I’m pretty sure those people killed him.
Oh well. Circle of Life.",266.0,rec

What’s your sign? In Western astrology, it’s a constellation determined by when your birthday falls in the calendar. But according to the Chinese zodiac (生肖), it’s your shuxiang, meaning the animal assigned to your birth year. Of the many myths explaining these animal signs and their arrangement, the most enduring one is that of The Great Race. Megan Campisi and Pen-Pen Chen recounts this classic myth.

DC’s El Diablo—also known as Rafael Sandoval, Chato Santana, and Lazarus Lane—is known as both a hero, anti-hero, and even villain in the comic book world. Most recently fans have seen this superhero in the DC cinematic universe’s latest film Suicide Squad, fighting alongside the likes of Deadshot, Harley Quinn, Killer Croc, Katana, and Captain Boomerang. El Diablo is a mysterious comic character, so join us as WatchMojo explores all three El Diablo origin stories.

As with most comic book characters, there are often re-imaginations and different versions to a character’s past. We have chosen primarily to follow the storyline which unfolded in 1970’s All-Star Western #2 and which was expanded upon in 1989’s Secret Origins #2, 2006’s Jonah Hex #11 and 2008’s El Diablo #1.

You're a restaurant owner in crisis, the wolves are at the door, but the customers aren't. You've got temperamental chefs in the kitchen, lazy waiting staff and the diners you do have aren't satisfied. Desperate for restaurant resuscitation? Call in the restaurant trade's equivalent of the Emergency Services - the inimitable, indomitable Gordon Ramsay. 

Each week in Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares, a struggling restaurant receives the Gordon Ramsay treatment. With only a couple of weeks to turn around its flagging fortunes, nothing is sacred. There's no time for polite small talk as Gordon reveals a few home truths to the exhausted, emotional restaurant owner or manager and embarks upon his mission to turn things around.

Of time and for most of the time to head is completely motionless and it's vision is very clear speaking of things that move in neat ways let's talk about the rolling shutter effect this especially happens on a lot of camera phones that record video not by taking a complete picture one after the other really fast but instead scan the available Optical space really quickly but they don't always do it quickly enough if you report an object that's moving really fast that object might be in a different place later on in the scan field now what that means that if I record something really fast like a vibrating guitar string the guitar string will take on really bizarre shapes this is not the shape that the guitar string makes in slow motion instead,0.9727640748023988,UCKXbq6IGFelzryn7fH6A-aw,Cool Things To Know - Part 2,LEANBACK,START HERE: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmmliCMNths&list=PLCC8FE4E06EA4941C,92.0,edu

First reports estimated that 135 people fell victim to these ""man-eaters,"" but further research published in 2009 lessened that number to 35 individuals. Over the years, different theories  as to what motivated these attacks have varied, and recently we got to talk with two experts who are working towards finding an answer.

LYRICS:

Cinco de la mañana tú me llama
Solo pa ver quien está en mi cama
Yo no tengo tiempo pa tu drama
A mi no me llame a la cinco de la mañana

Porqué de seguro ando de rumba con mi hermana 
Tu quieres llamarme y solo cuando tienes ganas 
Me fui a bailar esta noche
Voy a disfrutar sin reproches

Te pones celoso
Si me ve con otro
Hago lo que quiero 
Solo me la gozo

Te pones celoso
Si bailo con otro
Yo no soy de ellos 
Ni tuya tampoco

Se que me celas
Y yo te veo
Y tu me miras 
Yo me meneo

Te pones celoso
Si bailo con otro
Hago lo que quiero
Solo me la gozo

Le hago 
rompompompom 
Tú quiere 
rompompompom 
Le hago
rompompompom
Tú quiere
rompompompom

No necesito que me pague a mi los tragos 
Eres intenso estás haciendo demasiado
Tiene dinero pero yo también trabajo
yo no pregunto, si lo quiero yo lo hago

Se que tú quieres probar mi piel
No soy de esas lo sabes bien 
Ya te lo dije más de una vez 
Que ya no voy a caer

Te pones celoso
Si me ve con otro 
Hago lo que quiero 
Solo me la gozo

Te pones celoso 
Si bailo con otro
Yo no soy de ellos 
Ni tuya tampoco

Se que me celas 
Y yo te veo
Y tu me miras 
Yo me meneo

Te pones celoso
Si bailo con otro 
Hago lo que quiero 
Solo me la gozo

Le hago
rompompompom
Tú quiere 
rompompompom
Le hago 
rompompompom 
Tú quiere 
rompompompom

King Shark is monstrous, terrifying, and a formidable foe for many characters in the DC universe. His origin is as interesting as the character himself, as it's hard to pin down exactly what King Shark really is. On this edition of Supervillain Origins, we'll try to get to the bottom of this character, and take a look at the many times he's stood in the way of the pantheon of DC heroes.

Doc's friend Lambie is included and lights and sounds are activated when she is on the checkup table. Future doctors can use the electronic Big Book of Boo Boos to make a diagnosis, slide in play x-rays to activate lights and Lambie phrases and move the leaf up and down to measure their patient's height. Kids can also use the portable scale to check their patient's weight and take the ouches away with bandage stickers from the dispenser on the clinic door.

Create a space full of imaginative play for your child with the Disney Doc McStuffins Get Better Checkup Center. This play set allows your child to play pretend as they diagnose Lambie with the Big Book of BooBoos, or even as they check out her x-rays. It includes everything needed to give the included lamb doll a checkup with a scale, growing chart and play x-ray machine. You can even give her bandage stickers to take her ouchies away, too. The Disney Doc McStuffins Get Better Checkup Center Play Set includes checkup center, otoscope, reflex hammer, syringe, roll of stickers, two x-rays, scale, Lambie figurine, cell phone, and three peg board holders. Some assembly is required. It's recommended for children three years of age and older.

Also called: ""Doctora Juguetes"" ""Dr. Plüssi"" ""ドックはおもちゃドクター"" ""Klinika dla pluszaków"" ""Doutora Brinquedos"" ""Доктор Плюшева"" ""Dottoressa Peluche"".

Insects are everywhere! They're found on every continent including Antarctica, and nearly a million species of insects have been discovered! Since new insects are being discovered all the time, scientists suspect that millions more are just waiting for us to find them. You've probably seen plenty of insects in your life - bees, ants, butterflies, beetles, and mosquitoes - and you may even know that all insects have six legs. But do you know why we don't have giant insects? The secret is in how they breathe!

Shielded by our thick skulls and swaddled in layers of protective tissue, the human brain is extremely difficult to observe in action. Luckily, scientists can use brain organoids — pencil eraser-sized masses of cells that function like human brains but aren’t part of an organism — to look closer. How do they do it? And is it ethical? Madeline Lancaster shares how to make a brain in a lab.

We wanted to put assumptions to the test to see what we're missing out on because we're so busy assuming we already ""know"" a person. Join us as we discover why you should never judge a book by it’s cover in our series, Reverse Assumptions.

We are all conditioned with certain biases. In this experiment, we challenged these biases by asking people to make assumptions about their partner's appearance without ever actually seeing their partner. When they flipped around to finally face each other, they were shocked by how wrong they were.

Of all the species that humans have domesticated, dogs are our oldest animal friends. But how did a group of wolves become the furry pup at the end of the bed? New research is finally unlocking the paw-in-hand evolution of dogs and humans. In this episode we’re answering one big question: Did we domesticate dogs, or did dogs domesticate us? 

Special thanks to our friends from MinuteEarth!

Venom is a lot of things: deadly, dastardly, mysterious... did we mention deadly? Though the Venom Symbiote has had many hosts, and a long backstory that is as confusing as it is fascinating, he has nonetheless become one of Spider-Man's best-known villains and one of Marvels' premier characters.  

As with most comic book characters, there are often re-imaginings and different versions to a character’s past. We have chosen primarily to follow the storyline which unfolded in 1984’s Amazing Spider-Man #258 and 1985’s Web of Spider-Man #1 and which was expanded upon in 1988’s Amazing Spider-Man #300, 1995’s Venom Super-Special #1, 2009’s Venom: Dark Origin #1, and 2016’s Venom Space Knight #8 and 12.

Have you ever noticed that warning about raw or undercooked seafood at the bottom of restaurant menus? Ever wondered why it’s there? Because fish carry a ton of parasites, and if they aren’t prepared correctly then those parasites can make it into your body. But it turns out, this fishy intersection with the wild world of parasites can teach us a lot about how these moochers help keep ecosystems healthy, and why we should protect them.

These are the longest insect in the world and are expert at moving and looking like sticks. 

The Phasmatodea (sometimes called Phasmida or Phasmatoptera) are an order of insects, whose members are variously known as stick insects (in Europe and Australasia), walking sticks or stick-bugs (in the United States and Canada), phasmids, ghost insects and leaf insects (generally the family Phylliidae). The ordinal name is derived from the Ancient Greek φάσμα phasma, meaning an apparition or phantom, and refers to the resemblance of many species to sticks or leaves. Their natural camouflage can make them extremely difficult to spot. Phasmatodea can be found all over the world in warmer zones, especially the tropics and subtropics. The greatest diversity is found in Southeast Asia and South America, followed by Australia. Phasmids also have a considerable presence in the continental United States, mainly in the Southeast.

Phasmatodea species exhibit mechanisms for defense from predators that both prevent an attack from happening in the first place (primary defense) and are deployed after an attack has been initiated (secondary defense). The defense mechanism most readily identifiable with Phasmatodea is camouflage, in the form of plant mimicry. Most phasmids are known for effectively replicating the forms of sticks and leaves, and the bodies of some species (such as Orxines macklotti and Palophus centaurus) are covered in mossy or lichenous outgrowths that supplement their disguise. Some species have the ability to change color as their surroundings shift (Bostra scabrinota, Timema californica). In a further behavioral adaptation to supplement crypsis, a number of species perform a rocking motion where the body is swayed from side to side; this is thought to mimic the movement of leaves or twigs swaying in the breeze. Another method by which stick insects avoid predation and resemble twigs is by feigning death (thanatosis), where the insect enters a motionless state that can be maintained for a long period. The nocturnal feeding habits of adults also help Phasmatodea to remain concealed from predators.

Last week's video: Climate Science - What You Need to Know https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffjIyms1BX4

Scientists overwhelmingly agree that our climate is changing, Earth is getting warmer, sea levels are rising, and it's primarily because of humans putting lots of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Yet 4 in 10 Americans aren't convinced
Here's what psychologists and sociologists have to say about why some people don't believe in climate science.

Asteroid mining sounds like something out of a bad space movie, but harvesting materials from space rocks might be our ticket to building space colonies or living on Mars. Most of Earth’s precious and rare metals are locked too far in the crust for us to get at them, and launching them to space is too expensive for us to supply large colonies off Earth or explore far off worlds. How do we get our hands on the planetary resources inside asteroids? Let’s find out!

Subscribe: http://goo.gl/Q2kKrD

The Joker is an iconic Batman villain and has been for years, though the origins and true identity of The Clown Prince of Crime are unclear. The Dark Knight has had his hands full with The Joker in a number of incarnations, from his beginnings in Detective Comics, to the film The Dark Knight, with Heath Ledger as The Joker, and Batman: The Animated Series, where Mark Hamill’s voice talent breathed life into the character. The Red Hood, the vat of chemicals, the tough childhood, and the difficult family life: all of these have been used in different ways to tell the story of how the Joker came to be.
